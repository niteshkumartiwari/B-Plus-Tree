| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this B+ Tree implementation, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Include** the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Considerations

This B+ Tree implementation includes several security measures:

#### Memory Safety
- **RAII Principles**: Proper resource management with destructors
- **Bounds Checking**: Vector-based storage with automatic bounds checking
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Comprehensive cleanup in destructors

#### Input Validation
- **File Operation Safety**: Proper error checking for file operations
- **Format String Safety**: Fixed format string vulnerabilities
- **Integer Overflow Protection**: Careful handling of size calculations

#### Known Security Features
- ✅ **Format String Vulnerability Fixed**: Secure `fprintf` usage
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Proper destructors and cleanup
- ✅ **File Handling**: Safe file operations with error checking
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Basic validation of user inputs

#### Potential Security Considerations
- **File System Access**: The implementation creates files in `DBFiles/` directory
- **Memory Usage**: Large trees may consume significant memory
- **Input Size Limits**: No explicit limits on key values or data size

### Security Best Practices for Users

When using this B+ Tree implementation:

1. **Validate Input**: Always validate data before insertion
2. **Limit File Access**: Ensure `DBFiles/` directory has appropriate permissions
3. **Monitor Memory**: Be aware of memory usage with large datasets
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep the implementation updated to the latest version
5. **Code Review**: Review any modifications before deployment

### Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent
- **Day 3-7**: Investigation and validation
- **Day 8-30**: Development and testing of fix
- **Day 30+**: Public disclosure and release

### Security Tools

This project uses several automated security tools:

- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing in CI/CD
